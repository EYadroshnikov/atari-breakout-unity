## Atari Breakout

![Atari Breakout]

Welcome to Atari Breakout, a classic arcade game where you control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks!

### How to Play

1. **Main Menu**: Upon launching the game, you will see the main menu with two buttons: Start and Leaderboard. Clicking on Start will begin the game from the first level. The Leaderboard button opens up the leaderboard, where you can view other players' scores.

2. **Leaderboard**: On the Leaderboard screen, you'll find a table with player names and their scores. You can navigate through the leaderboard using the corresponding buttons.

3. **Gameplay**: The goal of the game is to destroy all the bricks by bouncing the ball off the paddle without letting it fall below the bottom edge of the screen. Each brick hit earns you points. Beware, if the ball falls off the screen, you lose!

4. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys or A and D keys to control the paddle. The paddle deflects the ball's trajectory depending on where it hits the paddle.

5. **Scoring**: You earn 10 points for each brick hit. The more bricks you destroy, the higher your score.

6. **Final Screen**: After completing all levels or losing the game, you'll see the final screen. Enter your name and save your score to the leaderboard.
